    # String which is used as input for a Xanitizer license file. Note: It is recommended to use a GitHub secret to store the license file content like XANITIZER_LICENSE and access the content in the configuration via the GitHub secret parameter. Please see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets for details. Note: If the license is a floating license and a proxy server is used to access the license server, please specify the proxy server settings. If no settings are specified, the settings from the Xanitizer properties file will be used.
    license: # optional
    # Number of attempts to get a license token from the license server. Note: If the used Xanitizer license is a machine bound license, this parameter will be ignored. If the used Xanitizer license is a floating license it may happen that all tokens are in use or the connection to the license server is not available at startup. In such cases, no license token can be requested successfully from the license server to start Xanitizer and the headless process would terminate with a license error. When this parameter is set to a value greater than zero, Xanitizer attempts every minute to request a license token until the specified count has been reached. Setting this parameter to zero disables the repetition.
    licenseServerRetryCount: # optional
    # Relative path under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE where the project was checked out. Note: Please use the same value as for parameter `path` of the configured actions/checkout action (see https://github.com/actions/checkout#usage parameter `path`).

    findingsListReportOutputFile: # optional
    # Comma separated list of output locations of the findings list reports. This has to be either a list of files or the parameter has to be undefined or empty if no findings list reports should be written. Allowed file extensions are: pdf, html, docx, xml, csv, sarif. Note: If no report file has been secified, i.e., neither an overview report nor a findings list report, both a Xanitizer-Findings-List.pdf and a Xanitizer-Findings-List.sarif report will be generated in the checkout directory specified by $GITHUB_WORKSPACE with the optional relative parameter `checkoutPath` as default.
    findingsListReportOutputFiles: # optional
    # Boolean flag specifying if only findings with problem classifications are written to the findings list report.
    onlyProblemsInFindingsListReport: # optional, default is true
    # Boolean flag specifying if all the details of a finding are written to the findings list report, e.g. if the output contains all steps of a path. Note: Only relevant if the file extension of the parameter `findingsListReportOutputFile` is xml, html, or sarif.
    generateDetailsInFindingsListReport: # optional, default is true
    # The path to the Xanitizer configuration file of the project that should be analyzed. Either this parameter or the parameter `rootDirectory` may be specified, but not both.

    configFile: # optional
    # The root directory, to be used for default set-ups. Either this parameter or the parameter `configFile` may be specified, but not both.

    rootDirectory: # optional
    # The project name that should be used. Only relevant if the parameter `rootDirectory` is specified. If not given, the simple name of the root directory is used.
    projectName: # optional
    # The directory where to put the generated configuration file. Only relevant if the parameter `rootDirectory` is specified. If not given, the configuration file is generated in the `rootDirectory`.
    configFileDirectory: # optional
    # Boolean flag specifying if an existing config file is to be overwritten. Only relevant if the parameter `rootDirectory` is specified.
    overwriteConfigFile: # optional
    # Boolean flag specifying whether Xanitizer uses NodeJS to compile Angular and TypeScript projects to JavaScript code itself or not. This could be a potential risk if someone has manipulated the external ng or the tsc script. If the code is already compiled to JavaScript, best with a source map, this option can be set to `false` true - enables the compilation of Angular and TypeScript code to JavaScript by Xanitizer itself false - disables the compilation of Angular and TypeScript code to JavaScript by Xanitizer itself and some Xanitizer workspace information will be generated if Angular or Typescript files are found in the project not set - if this option is not set and Angular or Typescript files are found in the project, a Xanitizer workspace error will be generated 
    compileToJavaScript: # optional, default is true
    # Boolean flag specifying if npm audit should be executed. The npm audit APIs can be used to report on known vulnerable node.js libraries. This requires an Internet connection and so has to be allowed explicitly. This is only relevant for NodeJS projects.

    haltOnMissingSearchPaths: # optional
    # A comma - separated list of issue groups that will let the task fail if for any of them, a Xanitizer error issue occurs. Possible values are ALL_ERRORS, WORKSPACE_ERRORS, CALL_GRAPH_ERRORS, ANALYSIS_ERRORS, MIGRATION_ERRORS. If the value is not set, this means that issues are not relevant for the success of the task.
    haltOnIssues: # optional
    # Boolean flag specifying whether the task should fail if there are findings with a rating equal or higher than the value defined for `findingsRatingThreshold`.
    haltOnFindings: # optional
    # A rating value. Only used if the parameter `haltOnFindings` is set.
    findingsRatingThreshold: # optional
    # Boolean flag specifying whether the OWASP Dependency Check repository should be updated or not. Note: The OWASP Dependency Check is based on vulnerability data stored in a local repository. It is recommended to update the local OWASP Dependency Check repository on a regular basis via remote access to the National Vulnerability Database (NIST). If a proxy server is used to access the internet, please specify the proxy server settings otherwise the settings from the Xanitizer properties file will be used.
    updateOwaspDependencyCheckRepository: # optional

    exportSnapshots: # optional
    # The passphrase for the project export. The parameter is only used if an export directory is set. If the parameter is not set or empty, the exported project is not encrypted. Note: It is recommended to use a GitHub secret to store the export like XANITIZER_EXPORT_PASSPHRASE and access the content in the configuration via the GitHub secret parameter. Please see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets for details.
